        <h3><a href="#">Jake Mehew ↗</a> & <a href="#">NikNak ↗</a></h3>

        </p>
        <p>
          Jake Mehew’s Binaural Brainwave Simulator explores the intersection of
          sound, vision, and neuroscience through modular synthesis and
          digitally-coded visuals. The work delves into the musical potential of
          combination tones, creating immersive auditory and visual illusions.
          These illusions aim to rhythmically entrain the audience, producing
          psychoacoustic tones in the listener analogous to natural brainwave
          states. This innovative performance bridges art and science, offering
          a unique sensory experience.
        </p>
        <h4>NikNak | Ireti</h4>
        <p>
          NikNak is an award-winning multidisciplinary artist, DJ, and
          turntablist known for her innovative approach to sound. Her work,
          including the immersive album Ireti, weaves together elements of
          afrofuturist storytelling, experimental textures, and deeply
          atmospheric soundscapes. Combining turntablism and field recordings,
          she crafts experiences that transport listeners to otherworldly
          realms. Ireti explores themes of resilience, identity, and hope,
          offering a powerful and deeply emotional sonic journey.

        <h3>HYBRIDY</h3>
        <p>
          By <a href="'">Alberto Barberis ↗</a>,
          <a href="#">Rajan Craveri ↗</a>, and
          <a href="#">Serena Zanconato ↗</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          HYBRIDY is a multimedia installation composed of audio, video-dance
          and vibrotactile feedback, which explores the hybridisation processes
          between body and nature, instinct and technology, biology and
          algorithms, vibrations and sounds. The work draws inspiration from the
          figures of dryads — half-woman, half-tree nymphs of Greek mythology.
          The dance is intertwined with dynamics of fungi, roots and blooms, the
          video transforms real images into abstract compositions and the
          sound-vibration dialogue explores the liminal spaces between organic,
          analogue and digital. A symbiosis of entities that invites “solidarity
          with non-human” (Humankind, T. Morton), fighting against the
          predominance of one entity over another — Reason over Body, Human over
          Nature, Algorithm over Biology.

        <h3>WEISS / WEISSLICH 27</h3>
        <p>By <a href="#">Peter Ablinger ↗</a></p>
        <p>
          "komplementäres Rauschen", Loudspeaker installations and pieces on CD
        </p>
        <p>
          "Rauschen" - white noise - is the totality of sounds. At the same time
          the maximum and the minimum of information. The maximum, as everything
          always. The minimum, as infinite redundancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all the pieces of Weiss/weisslich 27 - in correspondence to white
          light - the spectrum of white noise is refracted into partial
          spectrums. In a way the sum of these partial spectrums results
          furthermore in being "white" (everything). The difference between
          (distinguishable) partial spectrums and their (indistinguishable) sum
          is the subject of these pieces.
